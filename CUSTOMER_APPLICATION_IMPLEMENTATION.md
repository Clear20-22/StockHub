# Customer Application System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete customer application system for the StockHub project that allows customers to apply for storage services and enables employees to manage these applications.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- Created `CustomerApplication` model in SQLite database
- **Table**: `customer_applications`
- **Columns**:
  - Personal Information: `full_name`, `email`, `phone`, `address`
  - Business Information: `is_business_account`, `business_name`, `business_type`
  - Storage Requirements: `item_type`, `estimated_volume`, `storage_type`, `access_frequency`, `storage_duration`, `special_requirements`
  - Additional Services: `insurance_required`, `packing_services`, `transportation_needed`
  - File Storage: `inventory_list_url`, `identification_doc_url` (Cloudinary URLs)
  - Application Management: `status`, `employee_notes`, `reviewed_by`, `review_date`
  - Timestamps: `created_at`, `updated_at`

### 2. Backend API Implementation

#### API Endpoints (`/api/applications`)
- **POST /submit** - Customer submits application with file uploads
- **GET /** - Employee/Admin retrieves all applications (with filtering)
- **GET /{application_id}** - Get specific application details
- **PUT /{application_id}** - Update application status and notes
- **DELETE /{application_id}** - Delete application (Admin only)
- **GET /stats/summary** - Get application statistics

#### Features:
- **File Upload Integration**: Uses Cloudinary for storing inventory lists and identification documents
- **Role-based Access**: Customer submission, Employee/Admin management
- **Status Management**: pending → under_review → approved/rejected
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive data validation using Pydantic
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with meaningful messages

### 3. Frontend Implementation

#### Customer Application Form (`/customer/apply-to-store`)
- **4-Step Multi-step Form**:
  1. Personal Information
  2. Storage Requirements  
  3. Additional Services
  4. Document Upload

- **Features**:
  - Form validation with required fields
  - File upload for inventory list (optional) and ID document (required)
  - Progress tracking
  - Business account toggle with additional fields
  - Service selection with pricing preview
  - Real-time form data collection

#### Employee Management Interface (`/employee/applications`)
- **Application Dashboard** with statistics cards
- **Filtering & Search**: By status, customer name, email, or item type
- **Status Management**: Update application status with notes
- **Document Access**: Direct links to uploaded documents
- **Detailed Modal View**: Complete application information

### 4. File Storage Integration
- **Cloudinary Configuration**: 
  - Cloud name: `dbqrx0n5g`
  - Organized folder structure: `stockhub/applications/inventory/` and `stockhub/applications/documents/`
- **Supported File Types**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, XLSX for inventory; PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG for ID documents
- **File Size Limits**: 10MB for inventory lists, 5MB for identification documents

### 5. Database Migration
- Created migration script: `migrate_customer_applications.py`
- Automatic table creation with schema validation
- Connection testing and data integrity checks

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Cloudinary, Pydantic
- **Database**: SQLite (local)
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons
- **File Storage**: Cloudinary
- **Authentication**: JWT-based role management

## API Service Integration
- Created `customerApplications.js` service for frontend API calls
- Error handling and user feedback
- Form data and file upload handling

## Status Flow
1. **Customer** submits application → Status: `pending`
2. **Employee** reviews → Status: `under_review`
3. **Employee** decides → Status: `approved` or `rejected`

## Access Control
- **Customer**: Can submit applications
- **Employee/Admin**: Can view, update, and manage all applications
- **Admin**: Can delete applications

## Files Created/Modified
